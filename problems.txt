Screenshot are placed in the root folder as a proof that backend is working fine with postman app, which you can download from google app store and test the backend.

The problem is while passing value of subdocumented array field from client side. You can check it by typing in browser "http://localhost:8000/#/"

The same problem is happening while showing those subdocumented array field values to client by running get api method.

Thank You.

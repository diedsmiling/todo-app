# todo-app

Build: Front end problems,

Frontend: There is some problem in frontend part, i am unable to figureout how to pass thos iteminfo array values to backend, as it is subdocumented model, most part of the application is working fine except that subdocumented array field. It always return an empty array.

Backend: Have tested backend using postman application to test rest api, all functions are working fine and I can assure that backend is working smoothly without any problem.

How you can contribute: Please help me to figure out how to save that subdosumented array model into database successfully so that i can understand that concept and mark this project as completed.

You are not only helping me but helping thousands of students who are seeking solution online.

About application: This is simple To Do application based on MEAN Stack technology {MEAN is Mongodb,Express,Angular,Node}.

How it is different from other sample applications ? : It help to understand 

a) subdocumented structure modeling in mongodb which hasnot been taught anywhere on interent as either paid or free course.
b) It teaches to use gulp, node, angular, mongodb, express, bower, all of these in single application.
c) after trying your hand on it you will be able to create sample applications of yours.

About me: I am a learner. I love to learn and work on new technologies. These moments i have dedicated to MEAN Stack, & trying to complete this sample todo application. 

Thank You.
